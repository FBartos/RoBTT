# Robust Bayesian T-Test (RoBTT)

This package provides an implementation of Bayesian model-averaged
t-test that allows users to draw inference about the presence vs absence
of the effect, heterogeneity of variances, and outliers. The RoBTT
packages estimates model ensembles of models created as a combination of
the competing hypotheses and uses Bayesian model-averaging to combine
the models using posterior model probabilities. Users can obtain the
model-averaged posterior distributions and inclusion Bayes factors which
account for the uncertainty in the data generating process. User can
define a wide range of informative priors for all parameters of
interest. The package provides convenient functions for summary,
visualizations, and fit diagnostics.

See our pre-print Maier et al. (forthcoming) introducing the method.

We also prepared a vignette that illustrate functionality of the
package:

    RoBTT](https://fbartos.github.io/RoBTT/articles/Introduction_to_RoBTT.html)
